# LatinBlogPortfolio
A demo site of a latin blog where users can create, delete, and search for posts. This site uses a mock api so some functionality had to be emulated. If any irrecoverable errors happen clear your cookies. This was built in React and designed to be accessible, responsive, minimalist, and aesthetic.

To download and run the project on your local, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Thrillseeker419/LatinBlogPortfolio.git

npm i
npm start
